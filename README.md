# ANTLR-Compiler

This project implements compiler for simple files using ANTLR. <br/>
The main aim was to understand how the different parts of a compiler (lexer, parser etc.) work. It was created for my class [Programmiersprachen und -konzepte](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/de/course.html?lv=051030&semester=2020W) at the University of Vienna.

## Structure




## What I´ve learned
* Working with ANTLR and it´s quirks to set up a compiler
* Creating a grammar using regular expressions
* Implementing visitors on a parse tree
* Java´s BigDecimals
* Compilers are actually **not** _(only)_ sourcery
